				<ol>
					<li>You provide a brief overview of your organization and the service(s) you require.</li>

					<p>You get in touch with me using the contact form.  The initial outline doesn’t need to be in any great detail, just enough for me to get a clear idea of what you need.</p>

					<li>We hold scoping conversations to outline the framework, format and scale of the project.</li>

					<p>We have as many conversations as needed to work out the details!  I’m highly collaborative and will ask you a lot of questions to tease out precisely what you’re after.</p>

					<li>I produce a proposal, the details of which are agreed between both parties.</li>

					<p>My initial proposal will include a methodology, deadline, schedule and cost.  These are not cast iron - we negotiate the final terms and ensure you get exactly what you need.</p>

					<li>I provide the final product within the agreed deadline and respond to any feedback.</li>

					<p>Upon receipt of deposit, I get to work, engaging with you throughout the process to keep us on the same page.  I will also resolve any follow-up queries within the scope of the agreed project.</p>

					<li>I issue an invoice, with final payment to be made within one month of project completion.</li>

					<p>I appreciate the financial constraints that differ between organizations and so provide a grace period for payments.</p>

					<p>Your First Project is Free

					<p>For new clients, I offer small-scale project support pro bono as a donation.  Although future projects are charged, I ensure my services are affordable so as to remain within reach of those with limited resources.</p>

				<header>About me</header>
				
				<p>Originally from the UK, I moved from academic history to working for the British government as a policy researcher and legislative affairs expert.  Trained to be deployed at short notice to provide expert analysis on any topic as needed, I provided policy recommendations and justification to senior government officials and Ministers.  I produced high-level briefing on subjects as varied as Brexit, environmental protection legislation, Eurozone economics, diplomatic relations, public sector transparency law, international trade agreements, healthcare systems, renewable energy, anti-corruption measures and the protection of democratic rights.</p>

				<p>When my American wife and I moved to the US, I knew I wanted to use my experience to benefit society by helping the nonprofit sector.  During my time as a volunteer I realized that many smaller philanthropic organizations would benefit substantially from some professional research, policy analysis and advice; however, they often lack the in-house skills or financial capacity to divert paid staff or volunteers.</p>

				<p>To that end, I started working freelance to provide affordable research support to worthy causes.</p>

				<header>FAQs</header>
				
				<p class="faq-q">What types of organizations do you work with?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">I will work with any group with a philanthropic or social benefit mission.  This can include (but is not limited to):
					<ul>
						<li>501(c)(3) charities</li>
						<li>Social enterprises</li>
						<li>Foundations (operating and non-operating)</li>
						<li>NGOs</li>
						<li>Charitable trusts</li>
						<li>Public Sector organizations</li>
						<li>Corporate philanthropic efforts</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p class="faq-a">I specialize in working with smaller organizations who lack the resources for dedicated research staffing, but I will consider requests from institutions of all sizes.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">Do I need a specific project in mind?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">Not at all!  If you identify a need, I’ll clarify what that is and how you might address it.  The solution may not be a service I can provide but I will work with you to advise on what your next steps could be.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">Why do you offer pro bono work for new clients, and how much does that offer include?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">I appreciate that all nonprofit organizations must carefully justify any expenditure on back office functions and operations.  I also know that for new clients I am an unknown quantity.  By working your first project pro bono, I get to demonstrate the quality of my services and the value I can provide your organization, and I contribute to a worthy cause.  Everyone wins!</p> 
				<p class="faq-a">Usually my pro bono projects will be up to about 10 hours of work.  Anything more than that I will flag early on and negotiate.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">Do you work pro bono for anyone other than new clients?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">Unfortunately not.  Much as I want to help you in any way I can (I wouldn’t be doing this otherwise!), this is my livelihood and I have a powerful need to eat!</p>

				<p class="faq-q">How do you work out the cost of a project?</p>
				<p class="faq-a">As part of my project proposal, I will provide a fee based on the complexity of the research, the use of specialist resources and the time it will take.  The time estimate will be based on previous comparable projects.</p>

				<p class="faq-q">What geographic area do you serve?
				<p class="faq-a">I’m based in Massachusetts, so most of my clients are in New England, but if the research does not require face-to-face discussions I’m more than happy to help those further afield!</p> 

				<p class="faq-a">At this time, I am unable to accept work for organizations outside the United States.</p>
